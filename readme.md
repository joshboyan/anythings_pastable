# Anythings Pastable

The site is a mobile-first, responsive design built using LESS for styling and Jquery for added functionality. 

The clients wanted a site for their food cart that matched the tone for their business; warm, inviting and rustic. I used photoshop to create inlaid wood-burned effet for the header and footer. I used a classic Italian color scheme and a polariod effect for the photos to emphasize their concept. In addition to designing and developing the site I wrote all of the copy.

Features of the site include:
- Google map
- Facebook feed
- Twitter feed
- Touch responsive photo gallery
- Photo slideshow on the homepage
- Sticky navigation after the header scrolls out of view to improve UX.
