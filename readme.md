# Anythings Pastable

The site is a mobile-first, responsive design built using LESS for styling and Jquery for added functionality. 

The clients wanted a site for their food cart that matched the tone for their business; warm, inviting and rustic. I used photoshop to create inlaid wood-burned effet for the header and footer. I used a classic Italian color scheme and a polariod effect for the photos to emphasize their concept. In addition to designing and developing the site I wrote all of the copy.

The site features a Google map, Facebook and Twitter feed integration as well as a touch responsive photo gallery and a photo slideshow on the homepage. The navigation is sticky after the header scrolls out of view to improve UX.
