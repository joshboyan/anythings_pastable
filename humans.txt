This is a site that I built from concept to completion.

The clients, Ed and Laury, wanted a site for their food cart that matched the tone for their business; warm, inviting and rustic. After interviewing the clients I drew wire frames and decided information architecture using wireframe.io. The site is a mobile-first responsive design built using LESS for styling and Jquery for added functionality. In addition to designing and developing the site I wrote all of the copy.
