            <h1>Portland Running Company</h1>
                        
            <h3 class="top">Scenario #1</h3>

            <p>The homepage is nicely laid out with a very descriptive picture of a man and women in their early thirties running at the Portland waterfront on a sunny afternoon. A picture is worth a thousand words and that one really nails down one of the buyer persona's for the site. Affluent, young professionals, male and female, age 21-45, income $35,000+, who live in the Portland Metro area and probably work downtown, no children, concerned with their looks, health and general fitness. The other buyer persona is serious runners, male and female, 25-60, live in Portland metro area, participates in 1 marathon a year, trains multiple times a week, looking for training partners, income 35,000+. </p>
            <p>The purpose of the site is to increase sales of running shoes out of their downtown and Beaverton locations. This is done by creating a community centralized around Portland running activities. This helps to create trust and brand loyalty in their customers. The site is striving to make the Portland Running Company not just a shoe vendor but a centerpiece in the Portland runner's community. The homepage helps to demonstrate this by providing links to detailed reviews of running products and events in the metro area and beyond. The site has a very pull centric marketing strategy with only a couple light and friendly calls to action scattered throughout the community building content but opens and closes with the large "Shop Now" buttons so users can quickly enter the conversion funnel if that is their primary objective.</p>

            <h3 class="top">Scenario #2</h3>

            <p>I found it very easy to navigate to the Brook Transcend 3 style. The information architecture of each level of subcategories was intuitive and easy to navigate. My only issue is I don't see a 3 M; only a 3 W which makes me think this is a wide model.</p>            

            <h3 class="top">Scenario #3</h3>
            
            <p class="top"><em>Running Routes</em> has a map of all the PRC recommended running areas in Oregon with directions and advice.</p>

            <p class="top">There is a wealth of training information under <em>Running Resources</em> in the main navigation:</p>

            <ol class="top">
                <li><em>Training Advice</em> is updated every week or two with research based running articles as well as detailed information about local running areas.</li>
                <li><em>Personal Coaching</em> has a list of 4 running coaches affiliated with PRC.</li>
                <li><em>Medical Tent</em> has a list of affiliated running injury rehabilitation professionals.</li>
                <li><em>Online Running Resources</em> has a number of online tools and calculators to assist with training.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="top"><em>Owner's blog</em> also has quite a bit of useful information and is updated with new content frequently.</p>
